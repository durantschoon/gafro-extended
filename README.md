# Geometric Algebra For RObotics

![Github actions status](https://github.com/idiap/gafro/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)

This library provides a geometric algebra tools targeted towards robotics applications. It includes various computations for the kinematics and dynamics of serial manipulators as well as optimal control.  

Please visit <https://gitlab.com/gafro> in order to find the entire *gafro* software stack.

## Installation

 mkdir build && cd build
 cmake ..
 make
 sudo make install

## Usage

gafro can be used either standalone or within a catkin workspace. In both cases it can be used in a CMakeLists.txt as follows:

 find_package(gafro REQUIRED)

 target_link_libraries(target gafro::gafro)

## Testing

This repository includes cross-language JSON test specifications for validating GAFRO implementations. Tests can be run using both C++ and Rust test runners.

### ðŸ§® **Mathematical Convention**

**This extended version uses Ï„ (tau = 2Ï€) instead of Ï€ (pi)** for all mathematical constants. This choice is more natural for geometric calculations and rotations:

- **Ï„ = 2Ï€ â‰ˆ 6.28318**
- Full rotation = Ï„, half rotation = Ï„/2
- Many geometric algebra formulas become simpler with tau
- All test values and examples use tau consistently

### ðŸš€ **Quick Start (Recommended)**

For the best developer experience, we recommend using modern command runners:

#### **Just (The Modern Make) - RECOMMENDED**

```bash
# Install just: cargo install just (or brew install just)
just help                    # Show all available commands
just build                   # Build both test runners
just test-all                # Run all tests (both languages)
just test-cpp-real           # Run C++ tests with real GAFRO execution
just test-rust               # Run Rust tests with pattern matching
just test-scalars            # Run scalar tests only
just validate                # Cross-language validation
just clean                   # Clean build artifacts
just dev-setup               # Setup development environment
```

### ðŸ“‹ **Manual Commands**

If you prefer to run commands manually:

### Running C++ Tests

```bash
# Build the C++ test runner
cd shared_tests/cpp
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run tests with pattern matching (Phase 1)
./test_runner ../json/algebra/scalar_tests.json
./test_runner ../json/algebra/vector_tests.json
./test_runner ../json/algebra/multivector_tests.json

# Run tests with real GAFRO code execution (Phase 2)
./test_runner -r ../json/algebra/scalar_tests.json
./test_runner -r ../json/algebra/vector_tests.json
./test_runner -r ../json/algebra/multivector_tests.json

# Run with verbose output and real code execution
./test_runner -r -v ../json/algebra/scalar_tests.json

# Run specific category
./test_runner -c scalar_creation ../json/algebra/scalar_tests.json
```

### Running Rust Tests

```bash
# Build and run Rust test runner
cd shared_tests/rust
cargo run -- ../json/algebra/scalar_tests.json
cargo run -- ../json/algebra/vector_tests.json
cargo run -- ../json/algebra/multivector_tests.json

# Run with verbose output
cargo run -- ../json/algebra/scalar_tests.json -- -v

# Run specific category
cargo run -- ../json/algebra/scalar_tests.json -- -c scalar_creation

# Run tests with specific tag
cargo run -- ../json/algebra/scalar_tests.json -- -t basic
```

### Test Results

Current test success rates:

#### Phase 1: Pattern Matching

- **Scalar tests**: 100% (4/4 tests passing) in both C++ and Rust
- **Vector tests**: 80% (4/5 tests passing) in C++, 60% (3/5 tests passing) in Rust
- **Multivector tests**: 43% (3/7 tests passing) in C++, pattern matching in progress for Rust

#### Phase 2: Real Code Execution (C++ only)

- **Scalar tests**: 100% (4/4 tests passing) with real GAFRO execution
- **Vector tests**: 100% (5/5 tests passing) with real GAFRO execution
- **Cross-platform support**: Windows/Linux/macOS configuration system

### Features

- **Cross-Language Testing**: JSON test specifications work with both C++ and Rust
- **Real Code Execution**: C++ tests compile and execute actual GAFRO library code
- **Cross-Platform**: Automatic path detection for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- **Dependency Detection**: Automatic detection of Eigen3, nlohmann/json, and GAFRO paths
- **Verbose Output**: Detailed configuration and execution information
